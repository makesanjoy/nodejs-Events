# nodejs-Events

                  Event Modules
Node js has a built in module called "Events",
where we can create,fire and listen for our own events
Emitter objects emit name events that cause previously registered listeners to be called.
So, an emitter object has basically two main features-

>>> with one event we call multiple functions
>>> we can pass paameters using events


Emitting name events
Registering and unrgistering listeners functions.
